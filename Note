Priliminary search 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing datasets from NCBI
SRA with keywords:
     (drinking water microbiome) AND "drinking water metagenome"[orgn:__txid2651591] 
     I will organize these datasets with environment information (such as year of sample, location of sample, please let me know if any other information you concern)

Both ENA and NCBI offer automatic downloading with sample ID, I will attach a workflow with datasets information. 

Drinking water microbiome (16S rRNA amplicon sequencing) from NCBI and ENA SRA/ERA databases
16S rRNA amplicon sequencing 

Year of sample, location of sample

Published work, title, DOI want to included, please send to me. 
I will provide the list of project number
